# Amjad

I have done some analysis on silver prices data using deviation, though it felt wrong but I couldn't say way.
after the week of statistic lectures I can say with confidence it does not work. So I changed my data.

New announcement : This is Amjad speaking .. I don't have the ability to analyse data yet I am still in the observing stage acoording to Noam Chomsky.
So if you are Rick or Lujain I want to say that I have improved alot during these three weeks and I promise "you will see something soon".
